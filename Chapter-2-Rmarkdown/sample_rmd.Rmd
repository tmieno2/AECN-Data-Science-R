## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "right"}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Including a table

```{r }
knitr::kable(iris[1:5, ], caption = "A caption")
```

## Inline r code

```{r echo = TRUE}
set.seed(2334)
yield <- 200 * runif(100)
mean_yield <- mean(yield)
```

The average yield is `r mean_yield`.

# Chunk options 

## `echo` and `eval`

**R code and results** 

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

**R code suppressed** 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

**Only R code (R code was not evaluated)**

```{r, eval = FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

**Both R codes and results not shown**

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

---

## `messages` and `warnings`

### both messages and warnings

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
detach("package:tidyverse", unload = TRUE)
```

### messages suppressed

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
detach("package:tidyverse", unload = TRUE)
```

### both messages and warnings suppressed

```{r, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
detach("package:tidyverse", unload = TRUE)
```

---

## `results`

No results are shown.

```{r, results = "hide"}
a <- runif(100)
a
```

But, this shows the above code was evaluated and object `a` was created.

```{r}
a
```

---

## `include = FALSE`

No results are shown.

```{r, include = FALSE}
rm(a)
a <- runif(100)
```

But, this shows the above code was evaluated and object `a` was created.

```{r include_ex}
a
```

# Caching

```{r cache_1, cache = T}
#--- repeat steps 1-3 B times ---#
MC_sim <- function(i) {
  N <- 50000 # sample size

  #--- steps 1 and 2:  ---#
  mu <- rnorm(N) # the common term shared by both x and u
  x <- rnorm(N) + mu # independent variable
  v <- rnorm(N) + mu # error
  y <- 1 + x + v # dependent variable
  data <- data.frame(y = y, x = x)

  #--- OLS ---#
  reg <- lm(y ~ x, data = data) # OLS

  #--- return the coef ---#
  return(reg$coef["x"])
}

MC_results <- lapply(1:1000, MC_sim) %>%
  unlist() %>%
  mean()

MC_results
```

```{r cache_2, eval = T, cache = T, dependson = "cache_1"}
MC_results
```
